# Final Analysis Report: Historical Data (2009-2018)

## 1. Executive Summary
*Status: In Progress...*

**Total Years Processed**: 10 (2009-2018)
**Total Records Analyzed**: [Pending]
**Total Students Consolidated**: [Pending]

## 2. Verification Overview
Comparison of raw data files (`NETDATA`) against control counts (`RESULT_COUNT`).

### Summary Statistics
| Year | Total Files | Verified Files | Match Rate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2009 | 1 | 0 | N/A | Stats Only |
| 2010 | 1 | 0 | N/A | Stats Only |
| 2011 | 1 | 0 | N/A | Stats Only |
| 2012 | 12+ | 12+ | High | Detailed Analysis in verification report |
| 2013-2018 | Many | Many | High | Detailed Analysis in verification report |

**Key Findings**:
- **Roll Number Fallback**: Successfully recovered thousands of student records where Enrollment Number was missing (marked as "Used Roll No" in reports).
- **Mismatches**: Primarily due to "Withheld" or "Absent" students appearing in one source but not the other.
- **Subject Mapping**: 446 Codes mapped significantly improved data readability.

## 3. Consolidation & Migration
Data grouped by **Enrollment Number** (Primary) and **Roll Number** (Fallback).

- **Grouping Logic**: `Enrollment` -> `Roll No` -> Skip
- **Subject Mapping**: Mapped codes using `global_subject_map.json` (446 patterns).

### Migration Statistics
- **Target Collection**: `students`
- **Batch Tag**: `2009-2018 Consolidated`
- **Total Documents Upserted**: [Pending]

## 4. Methodology & Data Treatment

### 4.1 Data Verification
- **Process**: Recursive scan of `2009-2018` directories.
- **Comparison**: `NETDATA` (Source) vs `RESULT_COUNT` (Control).
- **Matching Logic**: Enrollment Number is primary key. Roll Number is fallback key.

### 4.2 Data Cleaning (ACE JSONs)
- **Objective**: Standardize 10 years of Excel data into `ACE` format.
- **Cleaning Actions**:
    - **Header Normalization**: Uppercase, stripped whitespace.
    - **Garbage Removal**: Dropped columns containing only `0`, `-`, or `NaN`.
    - **Deduplication**: Removed duplicate column names.
- **Output**: Pure JSON files (e.g., `Netdata_2009ACE.json`).

### 4.3 Subject Mapping
- **Source**: `global_subject_map.json` (Derived from BU 2019+ analysis).
- **Scope**: **446 Unique Subject Codes** mapped to standardized Names.
- **Usage**: Replaces raw subject codes (e.g., `SUB1`) with readable names in the Consolidated database.

## 5. Next Steps
- Review mismatches in Verification Report.
- Use `Consolidated_2009_2018.jsonl` for backup or external analysis.
